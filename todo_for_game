Create a tetris clone.
Add a high score table upon game over. Only add score to the player if they're currently holding "down" during time that the block is falling. 
Make it so that every 10 lines you move up a level(and slowly/progressively go up).
Make it so that you can "hold" a piece for later use.
Make it so that there are actual states to teh game itself.
Have a menu state, a start state, a pause state, a game over state, a high score state.
import the high score table at the start of each game(and export if changed later on).
Let the player pick a level to start on based upon their maximum achieved level.
Award extra points for "dropping" pieces.
Nice to have but not necessary
Implement some sort of "shadow" system for pieces to show where the piece will end up before it's done falling.
Show the next 2 pieces coming down the pipe.
